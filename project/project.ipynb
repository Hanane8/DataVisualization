    "\n",
    "#### In this project, you will create an interactive data visualization application in Dash and use it to explore and understand an underlying Video Game dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You will also be following the CRISP-DM process (with its 6 phases) for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note! Your final Dash App needs to be a Python application using `.py` files (not a Jupyter Notebook, as in Workshop 4).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an initial Project Plan (which you can modify within your project group) to give you an overview of the project:\n",

    "How to use this Notebook:\n",
    "-  Firstly, make sure you have completed [1. Setup](#1-setup) which covers the Python packages, etc. you will need to use in your project.\n",
    "-  Secondly, go though [2. Datasets](#2-datasets) which introduces you to the datasets you will be using in the project.\n",
    "-  Then, go through [3. CRISP-DM](#3-crisp-dm) which covers CRISP-DM Outputs (i.e. documentation) you need to write during the project.\n",
    "-  Next, go through [4. Tips](#4-tips) which contains some tips for the project.\n",
    "-  Lastly, read [5. Submission](#5-submission) which contains information about submitting your project.\n",

    "- The folder `reports` contains:\n",
    "  - 6 markdown files (`.md`), one for each CRISP-DM phase, in which you will document each respective CRISP-DM phase for your project.\n",
